# cores2code

Welcome to the **cores2code** repository, the digital companion for the final week of the **Cores to Code (C2C)** summer research program. This repository contains instructional materials, datasets, and exercises designed to introduce undergraduate geoscience students to coding and data analysis using Python.

---

## 🧭 About the Program

**Cores to Code** is a three-week immersive summer experience hosted by CRESCENT (the Cascadia Region Earthquake Science Center). The program trains students in subduction zone science through:

- Week 1: **Fieldwork** – Collecting sediment cores from coastal sites
- Week 2: **Lab Analysis** – Stratigraphy, microfossil work, and core interpretation
- Week 3: **Data & Code** – Learning to work with and interpret geologic data using Python (this repo)

---

## 👩‍💻 Week 3 Learning Objectives

During this final week, students transition from physical samples to digital analysis. You'll gain experience in:

- Writing and executing basic Python code
- Loading and cleaning datasets (e.g., from field or lab work)
- Creating figures using `matplotlib` and `plotly`
- Performing simple statistical summaries
- Documenting workflows with Jupyter Notebooks

These skills help bridge traditional geoscience methods with modern computational tools.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Anaconda** (recommended):  
   [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

2. **Launch Jupyter Lab**:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

3. **Install required packages** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start with the first notebook**:  
   Open `notebooks/01_intro_to_python.ipynb` and follow along.

## 📢 Final Notes

This is not about becoming a software engineer—it's about learning how basic coding can help you be a better geoscientist. You'll be analyzing real data, automating repetitive tasks, and visualizing findings. Be curious, experiment, and don’t be afraid to break things (and then fix them)!

Happy coding!
