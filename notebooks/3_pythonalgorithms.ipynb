    "An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules designed to solve a specific problem or accomplish a particular task. In programming, algorithms are the logical sequences that transform input data into desired output.\n",

    "### Key Points to Focus on When Thinking About Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clarity:** Ensure each step is clearly defined and unambiguous.\n",
    "- **Correctness:** The algorithm should solve the problem as intended for all valid inputs.\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** Consider how much time (speed) and space (memory) the algorithm uses.\n",
    "- **Simplicity:** Prefer simple, easy-to-understand solutions over unnecessarily complex ones.\n",
    "- **Generality:** Aim for algorithms that work for a wide range of inputs, not just specific cases.\n",
    "- **Stepwise Refinement:** Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing or analyzing algorithms, always ask:\n",
    "- What is the input and expected output?\n",
    "- What steps are needed to transform input to output?\n",
    "- Are there edge cases or exceptions to handle?\n",
    "- Can the solution be made more efficient or readable?\n"

    "- **Finding Multiples and Maximums:** We implemented algorithms to find the first two multiples of 5 in a list and to determine the largest number in a list using loops and conditionals.\n",
    "- **Decision Structures:** We practiced using `if-elif-else` statements to perform different actions based on variable values, such as deducting money from an e-wallet based on a lunch order.\n",
    "- **Summing Even Numbers:** We calculated the sum of all even numbers from 0 to 100, reinforcing the use of loops, conditionals, and accumulators.\n",
