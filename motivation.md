# Motivation

Welcome to the CRESCENT Cores2Code Python learning module!

This short book is your introduction to using Python to explore geophysical questions. If you're new to programming, that’s okay — we’ll build skills from the ground up, and everything will connect to what you’ve already experienced in the field and lab.

By the end of this book, you'll work with data and models from a real research study and use Python to investigate a key question: _Which kinds of earthquake rupture models best match the geologic evidence observed in the Pacific Northwest?_

## Why Python? Why Now?

Geophysics today is inseparable from computing. Whether you're analyzing GPS time series, modeling tsunamis, or mapping seismic shaking, you need to work with data — often large, complex, and multidimensional. Python is a modern scientific programming language that lets you do just that.

In this course, you'll learn to:
- Load and explore geophysical datasets
- Make maps and plots of earthquake effects
- Compare model results with field observations
- Communicate your findings with code and visuals

## From Field and Lab to Models

Over the past two weeks, you’ve:
- Visited coastal sites and collected stratigraphic and microfossil evidence of past earthquakes
- Analyzed those samples to identify signs of sudden subsidence or uplift
- Learned how these records inform our understanding of great earthquakes

Now we turn to modeling. How can we simulate possible future earthquakes on the Cascadia Subduction Zone and compare them to what the Earth tells us happened in the past?

That’s what this capstone exercise is all about.

## The Research Question

The figure below shows an example of several earthquake rupture models — each simulating different assumptions about where and how slip occurs along the fault.

Each model predicts a different pattern of vertical land motion along the coast. The key question is: **which of these patterns are consistent with the geologic evidence?**

For example, paleoseismic studies of the 1700 Cascadia earthquake show that many coastal marshes subsided by as much as a meter. We’ll use Python to:
- Visualize these rupture models
- Plot the predicted subsidence and uplift
- Compare it to published field data

## What You’ll Do

At the end of the book, your capstone exercise will involve:
- Writing Python code to analyze vertical deformation from a set of rupture simulations
- Comparing these predictions to observed subsidence data
- Drawing conclusions about which models are consistent with the geologic record

## Why This Matters

These kinds of analyses aren’t just academic — they inform hazard maps, building codes, and emergency planning. Understanding which rupture scenarios are realistic helps communities prepare for future earthquakes.

This module is a first step toward doing that kind of impactful science. Let's dive in.
